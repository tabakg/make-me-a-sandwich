# Make Me A Sandwich

This will be a Python - JavaScript game that is based on matching halves of sandwiches.
Generally the game play goes as follows:

## Simple Version

 1. A grid is initialized randomly with sandwich halves, some peanut butter, and some jelly.
 2. The goal of the user is to click adjacent matching halves to complete a sandwich.
 3. Completing a sandwich opens up the space where one of the halves used to be, and allows new pieces to drop down into it's place.
 4. If sandwiches are combined anywhere in the board, they can be clicked to go away, gain points, and have their spaces filled.
 5. A sandwich reaching the bottom also disappears and grants a point.

## Advanced Version

 1. A sandwich reaching the bottom will disappear and grant a "sudo" point.
 2. With a sudo point, a user can match two non-adjacent halves. This is useful for when there are no more matches.
 3. As the game progresses, more different kinds of sandwiches to be matched are added (avocado toast, etc.)


Effects should include a satisfying squish when halves are put together. There could possibly be an animation to make
it more interesting too.
